"""
Basic Edge Cases Test Suite for Diet Classification System

This module provides fundamental edge case testing for the diet classification
system. It serves as a minimal test suite for basic functionality validation
and can be used for quick smoke testing of the system.

The basic test suite covers:
- Core system functionality
- Basic edge case handling
- System availability and responsiveness

This module is designed for:
- Quick validation of system deployment
- Basic functionality verification
- Foundation for more comprehensive testing

Example:
    >>> pytest nb/src/tests/test_edge_cases_basic.py -v
    >>> # Quick smoke test
    >>> python -m pytest nb/src/tests/test_edge_cases_basic.py::test_basic

    Basic functionality test for the diet classification system.

    This test verifies that the basic test infrastructure is working
    and that the system can be imported and initialized without errors.
    It serves as a smoke test for the overall system health.

    Test Case:
        Simple assertion to verify test framework and system availability

    Returns:
        None: Test passes if assertion succeeds

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If basic system functionality is not available
