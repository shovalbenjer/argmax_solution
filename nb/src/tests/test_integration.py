Integration Tests for the Standalone RAG Classification System

This module provides comprehensive integration testing for the complete diet
classification system. It verifies that all components work together correctly
and that the system can be deployed and operated as a unified solution.

The integration tests cover:
- Module import and initialization
- Database connectivity and operations
- LLM client configuration and availability
- Cache manager functionality
- Core classification pipeline integration
- End-to-end system functionality

Key Test Areas:
1. Configuration Management: Validates system configuration and paths
2. Database Integration: Tests SQLite and OpenSearch connectivity
3. LLM Client Integration: Verifies Ollama client initialization
4. Cache System Integration: Tests Redis cache manager functionality
5. Core Logic Integration: Validates all classification modules
6. Pipeline Integration: Tests end-to-end classification workflow

Test Dependencies:
- SQLite database must be populated (run ingestion script first)
- Ollama service should be available (optional, tests will handle gracefully)
- Redis service should be available (optional, tests will handle gracefully)

Example:
    >>> pytest nb/src/tests/test_integration.py -v
    >>> # Run specific integration test
    >>> pytest nb/src/tests/test_integration.py::test_classifier_instantiation -v
